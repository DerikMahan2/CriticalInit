# 🛠️ Critical Init – Dev Log

## 📅 April 16, 2025

### ✅ What was accomplished:
- Created Unity project using `Universal 2D` template
- Set up initial folder structure under `Assets/`:
  - Scripts/Core, Combat, Characters, UI, etc.
- Created `GameManager.cs`:
  - Singleton pattern implemented
  - `InitializeGame()` method logs when game starts
- Verified script works by attaching it to an empty GameObject and viewing the console message

### 🔍 Current File Structure Highlight
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/GameManager.cs`
- `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`

### ⚠️ Issues resolved:
- Moved project outside OneDrive to fix permission issues
- Linked Unity + Visual Studio successfully

### 🧭 Next Steps:
- [ ] Decide core scene flow (title screen, gameplay, etc.)
- [ ] Add player object and basic movement
- [ ] Add scene transition manager or input handler
- [ ] Create UI to show “Game Initialized” message
